# Object_Recognition
Recognising objects with the help of Watson's Visual Recognition Service 

The apllication runs on a raspberry pi itself, this is because using VLC or any other media player will introduce delays in the application. However one can stream the the video on remote PC by making video stream over VLC.
This implementation requires one to download watson developer cloud by pip install --upgrade watson developer cloud and then you can easily run the apllication. 
Make the necessary changes in sample_script.py by changing the mail addresses.
After making all the changes you can simply run the code and get result on your mail.
Also do not forget to initialize apikey variable with your own apikey
